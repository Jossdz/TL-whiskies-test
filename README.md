<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (STARTER) -->
<h1 align="center">
  ðŸ¥ƒ Whiskey Collection Test
</h1>

Hello dear reader âœŒ

Here you will find the documentation for the project plus the decision making process for the project. If you are here by chance I'm sure you'll learn some cool stuff.

## Installation

1. Hit the star button (optional, just kidding)
2. Fork the repo (optional)
3. Clon it locally
4. Run `npm ci` or `yarn`
5. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the dev server

## Requirements

- Build a single page app that shows the whiskeis catalog.
- Make the user able to filter the whiskeis by region.
- Reference to the article
- Treat the JSON files as if they were coming from an external API.
- Follow the design guide for colors, units and images.
- Use any tech stack, but aproach the task as if the code will be use in prod.

## Tech Stack desition

Since I'm a huge fan of Reactjs I decided to use it but I had a hard couple of minutes thinking about the solution to choose when it comes to frameworks/starters, do I go for Nextjs, Gatsby, or stay with CRA.

At the end of the day I decided to go for Gatsby and here's some why:

- I imagine that the content won't change frequently being an e-commerce site so the whole content can be statically served.
- Pages being statically served from a CDN and pre-rendered at build time make a huge improvement in user experience since we don't make them wait a lot to get the content and Gatsby accelerates the navigation by fetching next pages on demand when hovering a link.
- Data is fetched at build time which improves a lot the experience for the client, users never spot a load time when the site is rendered because the data is already on the content. The fact of data fetched on build time is also a security improvement since we don't make a call to a server or an API client-side.
- Gatsby data management is the perfect way to simulate the data coming from an external API with the good addition of Graphql, the site will work as it's consuming a real Graphql API with just a small addition: a gatsby JSON data source plugin.

### Setup

Apart from the stack, I made the decision to add some development dependencies that help prevent errors and keep the code clean and maintainable over time and standardized for someone else or a team to work on it.

The tools for the static analysis testing are:

- Eslint
- Prettier
- Typescript
- Husky
- Lint-staged

The benefits of these tools all together are that each new commit triggers a set of actions to check the types, code linter, format the code, and last but not least make a new production build to check that the gatsby production site will work properly. The code will still work as always but now we have certainty that everything has a standardized code and the strongly typed system from typescript will help us prevent common errors.

## Live preview

One last thing I use for the project was Netlify, I was thinking about use voice for the project, I would have done it but I didn't need Nextjs and their lambdas, since the project is not that dynamic.

## Summary

The challenge was pretty fun and I end up wanted a glass of whiskey, on the way I notice that the approach was the right since we were looking for a production-ready site, fully operable, with continuous delivery integration thanks to GitHub/Netlify, extraordinary maintainability thanks for the static analysis configuration, easy and secured style management with styled-components and great experience with the benefits of Gatsby that deliver us an excellent site that is well scored over Lighthouse.
